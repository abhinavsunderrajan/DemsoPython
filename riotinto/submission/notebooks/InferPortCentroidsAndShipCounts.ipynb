    "## Objective\n",
    "This script clusters the stationary ship locations to infer port coordinates and count the number of distinct ship arrivals per day.\n",
    "The HDBSCAN algorithm was employed for clustering. As discussed previously, the clustering model was employed for each geohash  independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only issue with this approach is that port locations at geohash boundaries (if any) will not be inferred correctly. But this a tradeoff that must be made since it compuationally unfeasible to apply clustering on a global scale.\n",
